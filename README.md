# DJI_WIN_Driver

This package installs DJI drivers for Windows, more precisely, it configures the system to correctly recognize your device. Due to some trust-related issues of the original installer (signed by an expired certificate from woSign and with no timestamp) I signed the binary (and all .cat and .exe files contained within) by my valid certificate.

Hence, if you have trouble running the original installer, try this one.
